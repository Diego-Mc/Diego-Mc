          Hey! my name is Diego Monzon Contreras and I am a 23 years old
          full-stack and front-end developer. From a young age, I have always
          been fascinated with problem solving and spent much of my free time
          searching for puzzles to try and solve. When I was 13, I stumbled upon
          a blog about C# and fell in love with the art of programming and using
          code to solve problems. Since then, I have dedicated hundreds of hours
          to learning programming, including courses in Java, C#, JavaScript,
          and various frameworks and tools. I have also enjoyed tackling
          programming challenges on websites like CodeWars, using data
          structures and algorithms to find solutions.
        </p>

          At the age of 18, I joined the army as a non-commissioned officer
          (NCO) in HR, temporarily setting aside my programming pursuits. As a
          member of a team or organization, I always strive to excel in myself
          and improve the overall performance of the group. And as such, I took
          this job to heart and committed myself fully to it, volunteering to
          work more than 12 hours each day. My dedication and hard work paid
          off, and I was eventually promoted to Deputy officer and later became
          the HR Officer of my unit, managing the HR needs of over 500 soldiers.
          During this time, I used my problem-solving skills daily and even
          incorporated management tools like Trello and my development knowledge
          to write scripts that streamlined some of the manual tasks in the HR
          office.
        </p>

        <p>
          After completing my service, I further advanced my skills by attending
          Coding Academy, a coding bootcamp that taught me full-stack
          development using technologies like Vue, React, Angular, JavaScript,
          NodeJS, MongoDb, and PHP. I really enjoyed the fast-paced nature of
          the course with short deadlines, as I always enjoy being challenged
          and strive to excel in everything I do.
